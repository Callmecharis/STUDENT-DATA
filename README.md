# STUDENT-DATA
This is my personal project that i worked on to showcase all that i have learnt in the process of learning Data Analysis from Skill Harvest Academy
## INTRODUCTION/OVERVIEW
The Student Performance-BD dataset contains information on the academic performance of students from various regions. It features 24 attributes related to demographics, academic metrics, extracurricular activities, and other relevant factors. The data can be used to analyze student performance, explore factors affecting academic outcomes, and provide insights to help students choose suitable educational paths. student performance can be evcaluated based on several that affects student performance factors such as; location, parental involvement, internet access, guardian, study time, tutoring, school types, attendance, extra curicular etc.```

## DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION
In the process of data cleaning and preparation i performed the following actions
1.	data loading
2.	Removing unnecessary column
3.	Data cleaning and formating
4.	creating addition measure by adding conditional column on the data model 5.Data cleaning and transformation are critical steps in preparing raw data for analysis. In Power BI, we used Power Query to apply various transformations, ensuring that the data was consistent, accurate, and ready for analysis. Key transformations we applied included; using PROPER function to make the names of the student written in proper case using Excel function
5.	=PROPER(B2)
## DATA USED
The primary source of the data is gotten from ms excel and this an open source data that can easily be downloaded from an open source online

## DATA ANALYSIS
In the cause of the analysis, In summary, data analysis of open-source information is a powerful tool that can facilitate knowledge, promote transparency, and encourage shared progress. By engaging with these datasets. In analysis the data we able to deduce the cause of attrition, rate of attrition several measure as well as Dax function are used to generate the rate of attrition in the company, the department with the highest attrition rate, attrition by age-band, attrition by gender.

## EXPLORATORY DATA (EDA)
a data analysis method that uses visual displays and statistical tools to explore data sets for patterns, relationships, and anomalies. The goal of EDA is to learn about the data, rather than to confirm a hypothesis. EDA is an iterative process that involves: Data collection and cleaning Visualizing data Identifying patterns and anomalies Generating hypotheses EDA involved the exploring of the data with visualisation on Power BI to answer some questions about the data such as;The data can be used to analyze student performance, explore factors affecting academic outcomes, and provide insights to help students choose suitable educational paths. student performance can be evcaluated based on several that affects student performance factors such as; location, parental involvement, internet access, guardian, study time, tutoring, school types, attendance, extra curicular etc.
